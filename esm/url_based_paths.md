ESM are resolved and cached based upon [URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/)
semantics. This means that files containing special characters such as `#` and
`?` need to be escaped.

Modules will be loaded multiple times if the `import` specifier used to resolve
them have a different query or fragment.

```js
import './foo?query=1'; // loads ./foo with query of "?query=1"
import './foo?query=2'; // loads ./foo with query of "?query=2"
```

For now, only modules using the `file:` protocol can be loaded.
