* `src` {string|Buffer|URL} source filename to copy
* `dest` {string|Buffer|URL} destination filename of the copy operation
* `flags` {number} modifiers for copy operation. **Default:** `0`

Synchronously copies `src` to `dest`. By default, `dest` is overwritten if it
already exists. Returns `undefined`. Node.js makes no guarantees about the
atomicity of the copy operation. If an error occurs after the destination file
has been opened for writing, Node.js will attempt to remove the destination.

`flags` is an optional integer that specifies the behavior
of the copy operation. The only supported flag is `fs.constants.COPYFILE_EXCL`,
which causes the copy operation to fail if `dest` already exists.

Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

// destination.txt will be created or overwritten by default.
fs.copyFileSync('source.txt', 'destination.txt');
console.log('source.txt was copied to destination.txt');
```

If the third argument is a number, then it specifies `flags`, as shown in the
following example.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const { COPYFILE_EXCL } = fs.constants;

// By using COPYFILE_EXCL, the operation will fail if destination.txt exists.
fs.copyFileSync('source.txt', 'destination.txt', COPYFILE_EXCL);
```
